# A Predictive Model of Experimentally Evoked Acute Musculoskeletal (MSK) Facial Pain Based on Functional Muscle Recordings

## Overview

This repository contains the code and models developed for predicting post-MVC pain using features extracted from EMG and NIRS signals recorded from the masseter muscle during a repetitive clenching task. The project aims to provide a reliable predictive model of acute MSK facial pain based on functional muscle recordings.

## Features

- **Feature Extraction**: Code to extract relevant features from EMG and NIRS signals.
- **Model Training**: Scripts and models to predict pain levels using the extracted features.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive notebook for running the feature extraction and model training. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/MSK-Facial-Pain-Prediction.git
cd MSK-Facial-Pain-Prediction
